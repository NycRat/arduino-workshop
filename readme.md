# Arduino Workshop

## Random Notes

- Voltage is electric potential (can think of as pressure)
- Ohm's Law (V = IR)
- Too much current burns LED
- LED is light emitting diod
- Diode lets current through only one direction
- At positive terminal, V = max
- At negative terminal, V = 0

## Workshop Outline

- Basic circuits and electrical wiring
- Integration of Arduino UNO
- Arduino Programming
- Wiring Basic Arduino Circuit
